## Welcome to this project!

**"Love Live! UNOFFICIAL PROJECT"** is an Fangame lovingly developed by a LoveLiver, for all the LoveLivers in the world!

This game is being developed in the **"Ren'Py"** visual novel engine, and partially uses the 2D Assets from the discontinued official game **"LoveLive! School Idol Festival ALL STARS"**, such as Sprites, Icons, Cards, and Video Clips from its 3DMVs.

The implicit goal of this project, is the useful preservation of the content from the discontinued official games, giving life to a new game to pass the time.

> [!NOTE]
> _This repository will contain the source code of the game, at least for the most part. Sensitive code fragments or critical software data will be omitted or "redacted" from its release, for obvious reasons._

---

## Gameplay

This Fangame will be a **rhythm action game with Gacha dynamics** _(not as stingy as SIFAS)_, inheriting some similar mechanics from SIFAS, including an intuitive layout for any player. The rhythm beatmaps are made to be fun and faithful to the rhythm of the vocals and beats of each song. However, you won't need to be an expert rhythm game player, much less will you break your head with so many game stats unlike SIFAS. Oh, and you don't lose HP when playing notes _(read ironically)_.

> [!NOTE]
> _More detailed information about the gameplay will be given, as the game develops and the release date approaches._

---

## Asynchronous Online Events

This Fangame will have **online events with other players** _(not in real time)_, but the dynamics of the events will allow competition between players in the same way, both for global ranking and for asynchronous PvP competitions.

> [!NOTE]
> _This is still in the development phase, so there is still no very clear information about it._

---

## Release Date (Open Beta)

The approximate expected start of technical testing and the release of the Fangame in its Open Beta version is projected for December 2025 (at the latest). The project is currently almost complete, with **94.44% of the total progress** stipulated in the **[Development Roadmap][roadmap]**.
